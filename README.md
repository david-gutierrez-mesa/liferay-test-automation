# LiferayFormTest
## Description
This git project is a selenium example for automation

## How to run automation?

We just need to run "cucumber" task with Gradle in the root project folder:

```
gradle cucumber
```

Or execute test runner java file RunTests.java from your ID

## Test results
After test execution, a basic Htlm report is automatically generated in ./target/ folder.
